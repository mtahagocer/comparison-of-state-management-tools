# Project Overview

This project aims to compare three state management solutions
#
—Context API, Redux Toolkit, and Zustand —
#
when applied to the same problem. By examining the rendering effects on three distinct pages and evaluating the code quality and performance of each solution, we gain insights into the strengths and differences between these state management tools.

## Exploring Rendering Effects

Navigate to three different pages to observe how each state management tool impacts rendering:

- `/` for context
- `/rtk` for Redux Toolkit
- `/zustand` for Zustand


## Analyzing Code Quality and Performance

Delve into the codebase of each solution to assess code quality and performance:

- `app/(examples)/(context)/context.tsx` for Context
- `app/(examples)/rtk/store.tsx` for Redux Toolikt
- `app/(examples)/zustand/store.ts` for Zustand

### Getting Started


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

or 

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
